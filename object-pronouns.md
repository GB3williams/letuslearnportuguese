# Object pronouns

## 1. Direct Object Pronouns

###  Direct object pronouns replace the object directly affected by the action of the verb. They answer the question “what?” or “whom?” in relation to the verb.

Subject Pronoun	Direct Object Pronoun	English Translation
Eu	me	me
Tu	te	you (informal)
Ele/Ela/Você	o/a	him/her/you
Nós	nos	us
Vós	vos	you (formal, plural)
Eles/Elas/Vocês	os/as	them/you (plural)
o / a / os / as depend on the gender and number (singular/plural) of the object.
Examples of Direct Object Pronouns:
Eu vejo-te.
(I see you.)

te replaces "tu" (you).
Ele viu-me ontem.
(He saw me yesterday.)

me replaces "eu" (me).
Ela comprou-o.
(She bought it.)

o replaces a masculine noun (e.g., "o carro" = the car).
Nós ouvimos-vos.
(We hear you.)

vos replaces vós (you, formal plural).
## 2. Indirect Object Pronouns
Indirect object pronouns replace the indirect object, which is the recipient of the action or the person who benefits from it. They answer the question “to whom?” or “for whom?” in relation to the verb.

Subject Pronoun	Indirect Object Pronoun	English Translation
Eu	me	to/for me
Tu	te	to/for you (informal)
Ele/Ela/Você	lhe	to/for him/her/you
Nós	nos	to/for us
Vós	vos	to/for you (formal, plural)
Eles/Elas/Vocês	lhes	to/for them/you
Examples of Indirect Object Pronouns:
Eu dei-te o livro.
(I gave you the book.)

te replaces "a ti" (to you).
Ele trouxe-me um café.
(He brought me a coffee.)

me replaces "a mim" (to me).
Ela mandou-lhe uma carta.
(She sent him/her a letter.)

lhe replaces "a ele/a ela" (to him/to her).
Nós dissemos-lhes a verdade.
(We told them the truth.)

lhes replaces "a eles" or "a elas" (to them).
3. Placement of Object Pronouns
The placement of object pronouns can change depending on the tense and sentence structure:

1. After the verb (most common in affirmative sentences):
In European Portuguese, the object pronouns are usually placed after the verb and attached with a hyphen.

Eu ajudo-te.
(I help you.)

Ele comprou-o.
(He bought it.)

2. Before the verb (with negation or in some tenses):
In negative sentences or with certain structures (like in questions or with some verb forms), the object pronoun is placed before the verb.

Eu não te vejo.
(I don't see you.)

Ela não me disse.
(She didn't tell me.)

3. After an infinitive or gerund:
When an object pronoun follows an infinitive (unconjugated verb) or a gerund, it's attached with a hyphen.

Estou a ver-te.
(I am seeing you.)

Ele vai ajudar-nos.
(He is going to help us.)

4. Combining Direct and Indirect Object Pronouns
Sometimes you will need to use both a direct and an indirect object pronoun in the same sentence. When this happens, the indirect object pronoun comes first.

Example:
Ele deu-me-o.
(He gave it to me.)
Here, me is the indirect object (to me), and o is the direct object (it).
Practice Examples:
Eu vou ajudar-te com o trabalho.
(I will help you with the work.)

Eles mandaram-lhe uma mensagem.
(They sent him/her a message.)

Nós trouxemos-vos um presente.
(We brought you a gift.)

Ele comprou-nos flores.
(He bought us flowers.)

Vou chamar-te mais tarde.
(I will call you later.)

Quick Summary:
Direct object pronouns replace the direct object (the "what" or "whom" of the action).
Indirect object pronouns replace the recipient of the action (the "to whom" or "for whom").
Pronouns are placed after the verb in affirmative statements and before the verb in negative sentences or specific tenses.
With some practice, using object pronouns in Portuguese will become second nature! Let me know if you'd like more examples or help with specific sentences.
