## Naquela época 

### "Naquela época" translates to "at that time" or "in those days" in English.

"Época" means "era," "period," or "time" and refers to a specific time frame or historical period. It's used when talking about a broader context in the past, often associated with the social, cultural, or historical characteristics of that time.

"Naquela" is a contraction of "em" (in) + "aquela" (that), so it literally means "in that."

When you say "naquela época," you're referring to a particular time period in the past with an emphasis on what life or events were like during that period.

Why use "época"?
In Portuguese, "época" is used similarly to "era" or "period" in English when you want to highlight a specific moment in time, usually with a broader or significant context. For example:

"Naquela época, as pessoas não tinham internet."
(At that time, people didn't have the internet.)
The word "época" is more general and abstract than words like "tempo" (which also means "time"). It's used when talking about a specific period or era with particular characteristics.

Other Time Expressions with "Época":
Em outra época – In another era/time
Daquela época – Of that time/era
Época de ouro – Golden age
Example Sentences:
